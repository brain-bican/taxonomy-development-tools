# Seed your taxonomy from a spreadsheet

1. Pull the latest TDT docker image via following the steps defined in the project [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/brain-bican/taxonomy-development-tools/pkgs/container/taxonomy-development-tools): `docker pull ghcr.io/brain-bican/taxonomy-development-tools:latest`
1. Follow [instructions here](config.md#configure-seeding-a-new-taxonomy-from-an-existing-informal-taxonomy) to prepare your ingest config file
1. Save config file and informal spreadsheet taxonomy (as tsv) into your project's `input_data` folder.  (ex. [AIT115_annotation_sheet.tsv](https://github.com/brain-bican/taxonomy-development-tools/tree/main/examples/nhp_basal_ganglia/AIT115_annotation_sheet.tsv)) and configuration file (ex. [test_config.yaml](https://github.com/brain-bican/taxonomy-development-tools/tree/main/examples/nhp_basal_ganglia/ingestion_config.yaml))
   Note: Please ensure that file names do not include spaces, as they can cause issues when using the command line.
> ```
> run.bat make load_data
> ```
5. Launch TDT:
```
bash ./run.sh make serve
```
> For Windows: 
> ```
> run.bat make serve
> ```
This command will print a set of logs including a log like `nanobot::serve: listening on 0.0.0.0:3000`. This means your web editor is ready, and you can start editing your data.
6.  You can start browsing web taxonomy editor from: [http://localhost:3000/table](http://localhost:3000/table)

### Problems?

There are three frequently encountered problems at this stage:

1. Ports are not available

#### Ports are not available

You may get an `Ports are not available` error if the ports used by TDT (3000, 5132) are already in use
```
docker: Error response from daemon: Ports are not available: exposing port TCP 0.0.0.0:XXXX -> 0.0.0.0:0: listen tcp 0.0.0.0:XXXX: bind: address already in use.
```

Generally main reason for this error is that another instance of the TDT is already running. You can find the running instance on the Docker Desktop and stop it. Alternatively, you can run the following command to get the container id of the running instance:
```
docker ps -a -q --filter ancestor=ghcr.io/brain-bican/taxonomy-development-tools
```
copy the container id and stop the container using the following command:
```
docker stop <container_id>
```

If this error is not caused by an already running TDT instance, we need to find and stop the service using the port. To identify the service using the port, run the following command:
```
lsof -i -P | grep LISTEN | grep :$PORT
```

then stop the service using the port:
```
kill -9 <PID>
```
where `<PID>` is the process id of the service using the port.
