This will only need to be done once per taxonomy. You may need assistance from someone with basic unix knowledge in following instructions here. We will walk you though the steps to make a new ontology project 1. Download the wrapper script and pull latest TDT version Linux/Mac: seed-via-docker.sh PC: seed-via-docker.bat Make sure to save the wrapper script in your working directory and that the filetype is correct. You should have git installed - for the repo command to work perfectly, it requires a .gitconfig file in your user directory! First, make sure you have Docker running (you will see the Docker whale in your toolbar on a Mac) To make sure you have the latest version of the TDT installed, run in the command line docker pull ghcr.io/brain-bican/taxonomy-development-tools:latest NOTE: The very first time you run this it may be slow, while docker downloads necessary images. Don't worry, subsequent runs should be much faster! NOTE: Windows users, occasionally it has been reported that files downloaded on a Windows machine get a wrong file ending, for example seed-via-docker.bat.txt instead of seed-via-docker.bat , or, as we will see later, project.yaml.txt instead of project.yaml . If you have problems, double check your files are named correctly after the download! 3. Run the wrapper script You can pass in a configuration file in YAML format that specifies your taxonomy project setup. You can use dir in your command line on PC to ensure that your wrapper script, .gitconfig, and project.yaml (if you so choose) are all in the correct directory before running the wrapper script. Unix (Max, Linux) Using the predefined CCN20230601_project_config.yaml file: ./seed-via-docker.sh -C CCN20230601_project_config.yaml Windows Using the predefined CCN20230601_project_config.yaml config file: seed-via-docker.bat -C CCN20230601_project_config.yaml This will create your starter files in target/nhp_basal_ganglia_taxonomy . It will also prepare an initial release and initialize a local repository (not yet pushed to your Git host site such as GitHub or GitLab). Problems? There are three frequently encountered problems at this stage: No .gitconfig in user directory Spaces is user path During download, your filenames got changed (Windows) No .gitconfig in user directory The seed-via-docker script requires a .gitconfig file in your user directory. If your .gitconfig is in a different directory, you need to change the path in the downloaded seed-via-docker script. For example on Windows (look at seed-via-docker.bat ): docker run -v %userprofile%/.gitconfig:/root/.gitconfig -v %cd%:/work -w /work --rm -ti brain-bican/tdt /tools/tdt.py seed %* %userprofile%/.gitconfig should be changed to the correct path of your local .gitconfig file. Spaces is user path We have had reports of users having trouble if there are paths (say, D:\\data ) contain a space symbol, like D:/Dropbox (Personal) or similar. In this case, we recommend to find a directory you can work in that does not contain a space symbol. You can customize at this stage, but we recommend to first push the changes to you Git hosting site (see next steps). During download, your filenames got changed (Windows) Windows users, occasionally it has been reported that files downloaded on a Windows machine get a wrong file ending, for example seed-via-docker.bat.txt instead of seed-via-docker.bat , or, as we will see later, project.yaml.txt instead of project.yaml .

Push to Git hosting website The development kit will automatically initialize a git project, add all files and commit. You will need to create a project on you Git hosting site. For GitHub: Go to: https://github.com/new The owner MUST be the org you selected with the github_org option in the project yaml file. Repo name should be same with the repo option Do not initialize with a README (you already have one) Click Create See the section under \"\u2026or push an existing repository from the command line\" For GitLab: Go to: https://gitlab.com/projects/new The owner MUST be the org you selected with the github_org option in the project yaml file. Repo name should be same with the repo option Do not initialize with a README (you already have one) Click 'Create project' See the section under \"Push an existing Git repository\" Follow the instructions there. E.g. (make sure the location of your remote is exactly correct!). cd target/human_m1 git remote add origin https://github.com/hkir-dev/human_m1.git git branch -M main git push -u origin main Note: you can now mv target/human_m1 to anywhere you like in your home directory.

This document is designed to provide comprehensive details on navigating and utilizing the TDT interface efficiently. Whether you are looking to manage data tables, edit information, or leverage advanced features, this guide will assist you in making the most out of TDT. Tables Table Management Adding new Records Editing Existing Data Sorting and Filtering Data Actions Save GitHub Controls Make a Release Publish PURL Export CAS Json Export to AnnData Views Tables At the heart of the Taxonomy Development Tools is a robust internal database designed to streamline the management and curation of taxonomy-related data. Access to this database is facilitated through a user-friendly interface, with tables being a central component. To view the available tables, simply navigate to the Tables dropdown menu at the top of the interface. TDT categorizes tables into two main types, each serving distinct purposes: User tables: User tables are created when data is uploaded to the TDT using the load_data operation (https://brain-bican.github.io/taxonomy-development-tools/Curation/). This data is formatted according to the Cell Annotation Schema and organized into multiple interrelated tables. These tables include: - metadata : Contains metadata related to the taxonomy. - labelset : Houses definitions of the label sets. - annotation : Stores annotations for cell types, classes, or states, along with supporting evidence and provenance information. It is designed to be flexible, allowing for additional fields to accommodate user needs or project-specific metadata. - annotation_transfer : Tracks annotation transfer records. For detailed information on table structures and fields, refer to the Cell Annotation Schema documentation . System tables: System tables are essential for the internal configurations of TDT and are typically not modified by users. These tables include: - table : Lists all loaded tables and the physical location of the backing files. - column : Associates table columns with their respective data types. - datatype : Lists all datatypes existing in the system. Datatypes allow users to define regex patterns for cell values. The datatypes are a hierarchy of types, and when a datatype is provided as a condition, all parent values are also checked. - message : TDT allows users to load invalid data (invalid datatypes, value not matching with regex etc.) and displays issues on top of each table and column. messages table stores the found errors in the data. Table Management Adding New Records Add row button can be used to add new records to the table. Editing Existing Data Users can initiate the editing of records by clicking on the pen icon located at the start of each row. This action directs them to a data submission form that supports auto-completion, allowing for efficient data entry. After validating the entered data, users can finalize their edits by clicking the Submit button. Sorting and Filtering Data By clicking on column names, data sort and filter pop-up widget can be activated. This widget allows for the alphabetical sorting of data and the application of conditions to filter data accordingly. Icons next to the column header indicate active sorting or filtering, and clicking the column header again lets you update or clear these parameters. Actions Save All user modifications are automatically saved to the internal database. However, if user wants to save changes back to the source tsv files located in the project curation_tables/ folder, save action can be utilized. Version Control with GitHub The Version Control feature enables users to seamlessly perform GitHub operations directly from our interface. Before you can leverage these capabilities, it's essential to configure your environment by setting the GH_TOKEN variable. This step is critical for authentication and authorization purposes. For a comprehensive guide on setting up your environment, please refer to our prerequisites installation guide . Details to be added Make a Release The Release action facilitates the creation of a new GitHub release for the taxonomy project. This feature is part of our broader Version Control toolkit and requires the GH_TOKEN environment variable to be set for operation. For detailed instructions on how to configure this, please visit our prerequisites installation guide . When initiating a release, the action will prompt you for a release tag. The current date is the default value for this tag, but you can specify your own. It's important to ensure that your tag is valid and adheres to GitHub's naming conventions. Avoid using disallowed characters such as spaces ( ), carriage returns (\\r), new lines (\\n), tildes (~), carets (^), colons (:), double quotes (\"), question marks (?), brackets ([), and asterisks (*). For more information on creating well-formed tags, please consult the Git documentation on reference formats . Upon successful creation of a release, you will be notified of the new release's URL, allowing you to easily share or promote your latest version. Publish PURL A Permanent URL (PURL) provides a stable link that always directs users to the same digital content. The Publish PURL allows you to generate a PURL for the current taxonomy version, ensuring consistent access to it. For instance, a taxonomy might be accessible through a PURL like: https://purl.brain-bican.org/taxonomy/CCN202210140/CS202210140_neurons.json --> redirects to --> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brain-bican/human-brain-cell-atlas_v1_neurons/main/CS202210140.json Create a PURL once you deem the taxonomy mature enough for community sharing. This process will generate a PURL configuration file and initiate a pull request to the purl.brain-bican.org repository . Note: This step requires a fork of the purl.brain-bican.org repository in case you lack write access. Please ensure any existing forks are removed to avoid conflicts. The system will alert you if an existing fork is detected. Export CAS Json This action converts all data into a JSON file formatted according to the Cell Annotation Schema located in the project's root directory. Export to AnnData Apply your modifications directly to the associated AnnData file for the taxonomy. The metadata table contains a matrix_file_id column, representing a resolvable ID for a cell-by-gene matrix file, formatted as namespace:accession . For example, CellXGene_dataset:8e10f1c4-8e98-41e5-b65f-8cd89a887122 (Please refer to the cell-annotation-schema registry for a list of supported namespaces.) WUpon initial launch, TDT creates a tdt_datasets directory in the user home folder. It attempts to resolve all matrix_file_id references within this directory. The system searches for the corresponding file (e.g., $HOME/tdt_datasets/8e10f1c4-8e98-41e5-b65f-8cd89a887122.h5ad ) and then initiates a cas-tools flatten operation . This process, which may vary in duration depending on the taxonomy's size, results in a new AnnData file ( /tdt_datasets/$$TAXONOMY_ID$$.h5ad ) incorporating the user's annotations. Views Annotation tables are equipped to display data in a hierarchical structure, offering a more intuitive understanding of relationships within the taxonomy. To access this perspective, simply click on the Taxonomy View button. While in the Taxonomy View, users can visually explore the taxonomy's structure in a read-only format, providing a clear overview of the hierarchical relationships. To switch back to a more detailed and interactive tabular format, click the Table View button.","title":"User Interface"},{"location":"UserInterface/#taxonomy-development-tools-user-interface-guide","text":"Welcome to the Taxonomy Development Tools User Interface Guide.

These tables include: - metadata : Contains metadata related to the taxonomy. - labelset : Houses definitions of the label sets. - annotation : Stores annotations for cell types, classes, or states, along with supporting evidence and provenance information. It is designed to be flexible, allowing for additional fields to accommodate user needs or project-specific metadata. - annotation_transfer : Tracks annotation transfer records. For detailed information on table structures and fields, refer to the Cell Annotation Schema documentation . System tables: System tables are essential for the internal configurations of TDT and are typically not modified by users. These tables include: - table : Lists all loaded tables and the physical location of the backing files. - column : Associates table columns with their respective data types. - datatype : Lists all datatypes existing in the system. Datatypes allow users to define regex patterns for cell values. The datatypes are a hierarchy of types, and when a datatype is provided as a condition, all parent values are also checked. - message : TDT allows users to load invalid data (invalid datatypes, value not matching with regex etc.) and displays issues on top of each table and column. messages table stores the found errors in the data.","title":"Tables"},{"location":"UserInterface/#table-management","text":"","title":"Table Management"},{"location":"UserInterface/#adding-new-records","text":"Add row button can be used to add new records to the table.","title":"Adding New Records"},{"location":"UserInterface/#editing-existing-data","text":"Users can initiate the editing of records by clicking on the pen icon located at the start of each row.

This process will generate a PURL configuration file and initiate a pull request to the purl.brain-bican.org repository .
