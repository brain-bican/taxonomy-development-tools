# Taxonomy Development Tools

The Taxonomy Development Tools (TDT) is a taxonomy management tool for building, curating and publishing BICAN taxonomies in a collaborative fashion. 
TDT is a graphical editor that converts informal taxonomies used within BICAN into a standardised structure following the [Cell Annotation Schema](https://github.com/cellannotation/cell-annotation-schema) (CAS) with up to date links to the AnnData files associated to the datasets in the taxonomy. TDT gives you the opportunity to customise taxonomies by including both the CAS structure and additional fields defined by the authors of the taxonomy. TDT allows you to work collaboratively  across users to manage taxonomies thanks to the use of the GitHub platform to support concurrent editing and keep the taxonomy synchronised. 

With TDT you can:

- Create a repository to manage your taxonomies.
- Convert your data to Cell Annotation Schema representation.
- Run interactive web editors to curate your data with ontology search and data validation support.
